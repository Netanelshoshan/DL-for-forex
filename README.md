# Forex Price Prediction using CNN-LSTM 

In this repo you can find seminar, presentation and a demo, showing how one can leverage the use of deep learning method to predict forex prices.

This project utilizes a combination of convolutional and LSTM neural networks to predict forex prices. Specifically, it focuses on predicting the `EURUSD` currency pair's hourly price.

##### There are many ways to tweak the model to make it more robust, whether if its DBSCAN,DI,SVM to identify outliers and prevent the model from trading while there are sudden changes or by adding more features, setting up threshold for certain actions. Also, you can incorporate attention mechanism like i did in [here](https://github.com/Netanelshoshan/freqAI-LSTM) .
